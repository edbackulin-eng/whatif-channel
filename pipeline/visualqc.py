"""Look at every frame before it reaches the render, with Gemini vision.

The technical QC measures duration, loudness and black frames. It cannot see
that a frame contains garbled AI text, a face staring down the lens, or a card
reading "?" - and all three shipped in the first cut of episode one precisely
because nothing was looking.

A frame that fails is regenerated once. If it fails again it is replaced rather
than argued with, because a second bad generation usually means the prompt is
the problem and the pipeline should not stall on it.

Runs on its own model so it cannot exhaust the fact-checker's daily quota.

  lettering is the most important defect to catch.
- face: a human face shown in close-up, or anyone looking into the camera
